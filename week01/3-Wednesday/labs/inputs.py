# Please enter your name: Eric
# Hello, Eric!
name = input('What is your name? ')
print(f"Hello, {name}")

# Prompt the user for his name using the input function. Example:
name = input('What is your name? ')
length_of_name = len(name)
print(f"Hello, {name}".upper())
print(f"Your name has {length_of_name} letters".upper())

# Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's
# name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.

# (Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
